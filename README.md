# WIDS-Project
An end-to-end NLP and machine learning project for classifying news as fake or real. Covers text preprocessing, feature extraction, Logistic Regression with scikit-learn, train–test workflows, pipelines, and evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
# Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the work completed for the **Mid-Term Assignment** of the
**Winter in Data Science Programme**.  
The project focuses on understanding and implementing an end-to-end data science and
machine learning workflow for **Fake News Detection** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The rapid spread of misinformation through digital platforms has made fake news detection
an important problem in data science. This project explores how data-driven techniques and
machine learning models can be applied to classify news articles as *fake* or *real* based
on textual content.

The current phase (mid-term) emphasizes **foundational understanding**, including data
handling, exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

The work in this repository is organized across multiple Jupyter notebooks, each focusing
on a specific stage of the workflow:

- **Data Understanding and Loading**
  - Reading CSV and TSV datasets using pandas
  - Handling different delimiters and formats
  - Inspecting data using `head()`, `info()`, and `shape()`

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Grouping and aggregation using `groupby()`
  - Identifying patterns and trends in data

- **Data Manipulation and Integration**
  - Creating DataFrames from raw data structures
  - Index handling and alignment
  - Row-wise and column-wise concatenation using `pd.concat()`

- **Visualization and Interpretation**
  - Basic plots using `matplotlib`
  - Interpreting relationships and anomalies
  - Understanding limitations of visual analysis

- **Machine Learning and NLP**
  - Text preprocessing and cleaning
  - Train–test split for supervised learning
  - Logistic Regression as a baseline model
  - Use of scikit-learn Pipelines
  - Model evaluation using:
    - Accuracy score
    - Confusion matrix
    - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I developed a clear understanding of:
- End-to-end machine learning workflows
- Handling and preprocessing real-world text data
- Proper use of training and testing splits
- Model fitting, transformation, and prediction
- Interpreting evaluation metrics beyond accuracy
- The importance of pipelines and validation to avoid data leakage

These learnings form a strong foundation for extending the project to more advanced NLP
techniques in later stages.

## 🚧 Current Status

This repository represents the **mid-term progress** of the project.  
Future work will focus on advanced feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF) and improving model
performance using more sophisticated NLP approaches.
