In the West Bank cities of Hebron and Al-Bireh, thousands of demonstrators rallied with chants of  Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Palestine , witnesses said. Some Palestinians threw stones at soldiers. Eleven protesters was hit by live fire and another 20 by rubber bullets, medics said. A military spokeswoman said soldiers had used  riot-dispersal gear  against hundreds of rock-throwers. In the Gaza Strip, dozens of protesters gathered near the border fence with Israel and threw rocks at soldiers on the other side. Seven protesters were wounded by live fire, one was in a critical condition, the health ministry said.  Four people were wounded by live gunfire in the West Bank and another 20 were hit by rubber bullets, health officials said. An Israeli military spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Palestinian authorities called a general strike in protest at U.S. President Donald Trump s announcement about Jerusalem on Wednesday. Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital. Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.  Member of armed groups including from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas s Fatah faction, appeared at a news conference in Gaza, their faces hidden by masks and called for a resumption of armed resistance in the West Bank.  Abbas traveled to the Jordanian capital, Amman, to meet King Abdullah where he updated him on the latest developments, the Wafa news agency said\"\"\"\n",
